C# Single Level Inheritance Example: Inheriting Fields
When one class inherits another class, it is known as single level inheritance. Let's see the example of single level inheritance which inherits the fields only.

C# Multi Level Inheritance Example
When one class inherits another class which is further inherited by another class, it is known as multi level inheritance in C#. Inheritance is transitive so the last derived class acquires all the members of all its base cla.*/
